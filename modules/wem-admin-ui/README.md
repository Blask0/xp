## Building the UI

For now, we are using Grunt for building javascript sources. Please install Grunt (grunt-cli) in NPM before using it.
After installing Grunt, run the following command to install Grunt dependencies:

    npm install

Then, to compile TypeScript, type the following:

    grunt typescript
