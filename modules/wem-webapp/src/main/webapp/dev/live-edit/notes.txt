Live Edit currently make use of the following cutting edge web technologies:

* SVG (for highlighting)
* CSS Gradients

Which are supported by:

* Latest Firefox / Latest Chrome / Latest Opera
* IE >= 9


TODO:
* Try set cursor on the body element on hover events (not predefined in the live-edit.css)

* Create button sub class for each menu button
* Redefine data attributes. Scope data-live-edit-key value in order to avoid conflicts. Eg. "paragraph:2"
* Fix so drag helper tooltip width is not fixed.
* Make sure the pointer cursor that is added to the component on mouseover is removed on mouseout
* Remove SELECTOR strings from Regions and Windows
* Parent button: Dynamically resolve what the parent component is
* Use DOM Mutation Observers for changing the selected component highlighter dimensions / Alternatively use a timer and check for width/height changes on the selected component.
