CSS
* live-edit-component - the text should not break
* It is difficult to make the whole "margin" clickable. Create table like layout for Component in component menu. left cell for image, right cell for text
* Toggle should have an arrow (see sketches)
* It should be possible to change position -> discuss with TSI
* Scrolling in component bar
* The toggle bar collapses if eg. component title is too large
