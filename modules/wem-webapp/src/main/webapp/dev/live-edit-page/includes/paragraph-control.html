        components and supported multiple application servers and databases. Currently we support all major and minor application servers
        and all major databases. Scalability is secured using cluster technology, multi-level caching, and heavy performance testing.</p>

    <p>Our platform is built on well-known technologies like Java, Spring, Hibernate, XML and XSLT. To get you started we have provided a
        full featured Demo kit with example templates that demonstrates features and best practice. For development your may use your own
        preferred tool for both templates and plug-ins.</p>
